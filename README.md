# Cancer Diagnosis using blood based biomarkers

## Problem 
Build a predictive model for pan-cancer, with focus on GBM, using molecular profiles of blood-based biomarkers. Through this, obtain a reproducible and accurate biomarker set for pan-cancer

### Approach
Tackling this problem through a benchmarking study of feature selection methods to obtain valid signatures (biomarker set)

### Type of data used
Transcriptomic data - exosomal miRNA from blood-based liquid biopsy
